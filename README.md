# Machine-Learning---Iris-Flower-Recognition

Imports the Iris dataset from scikit learn and spilts the data into train set and test set. The sets are then ran through the kNeighboursClassfier to create a prediction model. 

Prediction model is dumped using joblib. And can be used to easy access for future predictions. 

Technologies Used:
  * scikit learn lib.
  * joblib. 
  * jupyter notebook.
